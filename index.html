        <div class="row"><p>Coffee contains caffeine, a central nervous system stimulant that is known for its ability to fight fatigue and increase energy levels .

        This is because caffeine blocks the receptors of a neurotransmitter called adenosine, and this increases levels of other neurotransmitters in your brain that regulate your energy levels, including dopamine .
        
        One small study found that consuming caffeine increased time to exhaustion during a cycling exercise by 12% and significantly reduced subjective levels of fatigue in participants .
        
        Another study had similar findings, reporting that consuming caffeine before and during a round of golf improved performance, increased subjective energy levels, and reduced feelings of fatigue .</p></div>

    <h1 style="font-size: 70px;">Types</h1> 
    <h3>A coffee bean is a seed of the Coffea plant and the source for coffee. It is the pip inside the red or purple fruit. This fruit is often referred to as a coffee cherry. Just like ordinary cherries, the coffee fruit is also a so-called stone fruit. Even though the coffee beans are not technically beans, they are referred to as such because of their resemblance to true beans. The fruits; cherries or berries, most commonly contain two stones with their flat sides together. A small percentage of cherries contain a single seed, instead of the usual two. This is called a "peaberry". </h3>
    <ul>
        <li><h2>Types Of Beans:</h2><p>The two main types of coffee beans are Coffee Arabica and Coffee Robusta. People also use a blend of both beans. Both types of coffee bean taste differently depending on where and how they are grown. What is the difference in Coffee Robusta versus Coffee Arabica? Do types of coffee beans used make a difference?

            What types of coffee beans are used in our famousNew Orleans Blend? It is a third Costa Rican beans, Guatemalan beans, and Colombian beans. The types of coffee beans we use are like gourmet coffee right in your home. Compare the types of coffee beans we use versus any of our competitors, and we are sure you will be impressed. We ship it so fast, we should tell you to wait a few days for it to peak.</p></li>
        <li><h2>TYpe of Roast:</h2><p><h3>Light coffee Roast</h3>One of the main differences between light and dark roasts is temperature. Lightly roasted beans are usually done at around 356°F-401°, right as they’ve hit the first crack. This leaves more oils on them than darker ones because it’s not hot enough to burn off all those tasty fats that give coffee its richness!</p> <br> <p><h3>Medium Coffee Roast</h3>Medium roast coffee’s internal temperature ranges between 410°F-428°. This is after the first crack and just before the second one occurs, which means they have more body than light roasts but less acidity.Most American coffee drinkers know medium roasted coffees because these roasts taste balanced in flavor with some acidity or “bite” and enough fullness to satisfy people who like darker flavors without feeling too heavy on stomachs that can’t tolerate more pungent tastes as well.</p>
        <p><h3>Medium Dark Roast</h3>Medium-dark roasted coffee beans offer a bold body and rich flavor with a slight bittersweet aftertaste. With this roast, you may get flavors like dark chocolate or almonds.Using a French press, use a coarse grind to avoid bitterness due to over-extraction of the bean; these beans are darker in color because they have been roasted for more extended periods than lighter roasts.</p> <p><h3>Dark Coffee Roast</h3>The roasting temperature for a dark roast is between 464°F – 482°F. The longer roasting process helps it develop a richer flavor and whole body, leading to a buttery finish. It has the least amount of caffeine because it’s roasted at such high temperatures that all the acidity in them has been removed or destroyed by now.Dark coffee beans are rich with oils when ground up, but they do not taste like much else except what you can tell about their origins, thanks to those sugars caramelizing during this higher heat cooking time.</p></li>
        <li><h2>Type of Grind:</h2><p>There are seven major sizes of coffee grinds. Keep reading to find out what they are, what they look like, and what types of brewers they are best suited to.

            For our comprehensive list of the seven coffee grind sizes, we’ve taken close-up pictures of each so that you can get an idea of the texture you’re looking for. For scale, we’ve added an American quarter, which has a diameter of 0.955 inches and a width of 0.069 inches.</p></li>
        <li><h2>Decaffeinated coffee:</h2><p>Decaffeinated coffee, known as decaf for short, is ordinary coffee that has had most of its caffeine removed from it before the beans are roasted. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for a coffee to be marketed as "decaffeinated," it must have had at least 97 percent of its original caffeine removed.</p></li>
